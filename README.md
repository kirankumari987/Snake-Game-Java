# Snake Game in Java

This is a simple console-based Snake Game implemented in Java. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

    ```

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to control the snake's direction.
- The snake will continuously move in the direction it's facing.
- Eat the food (`@`) to grow longer.
